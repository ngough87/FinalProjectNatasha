### Overview
Collaborative project starting with database schema creation, and wireframe buildout. Project monitoring was achieved through trello board user stories. 

Our team decided to make an application called Paseo. Paseo is a meant to be a community where a walk loving user can connect with other likeminded users. With Paseo, users can search for others in their area in accordance with a variety of preferences selected by the user. On the one hand, if a user wanted a one on one connection, they can do so by connecting with other individuals via private messageing. On the other, if a user is open to meeting up with mutiple people with a variety of preferences they can create a "walkers wanted ad" which is a white pages of sorts, intended for groups or individuals to connect. 

At the onset of the project, our team thought that it would require very little in the way of database tables. As we went through the planning process, we realized in order to acheive a product with the functionality we want, we would need a robust database. We ended with 10 tables and 5 join tables.

After completing all of the required 29 entities classes, including several key classes, and jUnit tests, we moved on to completing user stories from our trello board. As we worked through each story, we built out required repository, services, serviceImpls and controllers. We also tested necessary routing via Postman ensuring we were getting the right data.
